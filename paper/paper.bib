  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Testing for correlations between different sets of
              genomic features is a fundamental task in genomics research.
              However, searching for overlaps between features with existing
              web-based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that are
              routinely produced with current sequencing technologies. Fast and
              flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex questions of
              these data in an efficient manner. RESULTS: This article
              introduces a new software suite for the comparison, manipulation
              and annotation of genomic features in Browser Extensible Data
              (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF) format. BEDTools also
              supports the comparison of sequence alignments in BAM format to
              both BED and GFF features. The tools are extremely efficient and
              allow the user to compare large datasets (e.g. next-generation
              sequencing data) with both public and custom genome annotation
              tracks. BEDTools can be combined with one another as well as with
              standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks
              as well as pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions
              of large genomic datasets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:
              BEDTools was written in C++. Source code and a comprehensive user
              manual are freely available at http://code.google.com/p/bedtools
